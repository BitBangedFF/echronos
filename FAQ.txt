Does the AGPL license also apply to programs that use the eChronos kernel?

Yes.
The license also covers user programs that use eChronos services through system calls.
Linking eChronos statically or dynamically with other modules is considered making a combined work based on eChronos.
Thus, the terms and  conditions of the AGPLv3 cover the whole combination (see: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLStaticVsDynamic).

We specifically do not provide a FreeRTOS-like exception to the GPL.
