Introduction
-------------

The ARMv7M package provides the following modules:

build
  ~ A build module.
vectable
  ~ A module generates an appropriate vector table.


`armv7m/build`
==============

The build module supports the *system build* interface.
The module does not support any options.
For correct operation the system must include at least one C or assembler file.
The system must also have an assigned linker-script.
It is recommended that the vectable module is used to provide a functional linker-script.

`armv7m/vectable`
==============

The vectable module generates an appropriate vector table for the system.
The vector table controls system booting, including both the stack and entry pointer.
Currently the vectable is not configurable (This is expected to change in the future).
The entry point is `main()`.
All other exceptions result in a system reset.
The stack-size is hardcoded to 1024 bytes.
The ROM location (and vector table) is hardcoded to address 0x0.
The RAM location is hardcoded to 0x2000.0000.
