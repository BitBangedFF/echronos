Introduction
-------------

The PowerPC package provides support for a QEMU emulated PowerPC machine.
It provides the following modules:

build
  ~ A build module.
entry
  ~ A module that generates an appropriate linker script.
debug
  ~ A module that provides the *low-level debug* interface.

It also includes modules for example systems:

hello
  ~ A system that does the standard *Hello, world*.
acamar-system
  ~ A system demonstrating context switch between two tasks via rtos_yield_to().

These systems can be run on qemu-ppc, provided with standard apt package installations of qemu.

`ppc/build`
==============

The build module supports the *system build* interface.
It assumes the presence of a GNU PowerPC cross-compiler on PATH with toolchain prefix powerpc-linux-gnu-.
This toolchain can be obtained via a standard installation of the apt package gcc-powerpc-linux-gnu.
The system must also have an assigned linker-script.
It is recommended that the entry module is used to provide a functional linker-script.

`ppc/debug`
==============

The debug module supports the *low-level debug* interface.
It provides the `ppc_debug_putc` function.

### `ppc_debug_putc`

    void ppc_debug_putc(char c)

This function is not currently implemented, and is only a placeholder stub to assist GDB debugging.
Alternatively, the generic debug_println function may be another convenient location to place a breakpoint.
To obtain a PowerPC-compatible build of GDB, it must be built from source after running ./configure --target=powerpc-linux-gnu.
