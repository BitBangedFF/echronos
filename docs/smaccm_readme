SMACCM RTOS Release v0.0.1
==========================

Release overview
-----------------

The RTOS release contains a tool `prj` which is used for configuring
the RTOS and (optionally) building systems based on the RTOS. The
`prj` tool can be found in the `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin` directory.

The RTOS itself is organised as a series of packages stored in the
`share/packages` directory. These are described in the following
sections.

For completeness, `LICENSE` contains the license under which this
release is made available and `build_info` contains the specific
build information used to uniquely identify the release.

Installation
-------------

To install the RTOS simply extract the release archive in to a
suitable location. This can either be within a specific project
directory, (e.g: `project/rtos`) or in a more general location (e.g:
~/local/rtos).

The `prj` binary is used to configure the RTOS, so should installed
so that it is convenient to use. This can be done by adding
`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin` to the PATH environment variable,
creating a symbolic link the the `prj` binary, or simply using the
full path within a build system. E.g.: In `make`:

    PRJ := /path/to/rtos/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/prj

Although the `prj` binary can be used anywhere on the filesystem,
the overall structure of the release should be maintained, as this
is used to determine the location of `packages` directory.

`prj` should work on any modern Linux distribution. It depends on
zlib (version 1.2.0) and glibc (version 2.14).

Note: Mac OS X support is available, but not provided in this release.
Please advise if OS X support is desirable.
