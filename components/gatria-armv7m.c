/**
 * Set up the initial execution context of a task.
 * This function is invoked exactly once for each task in the system.
  *
 * @param ctx An output parameter interpreted by the RTOS as the initial context for each task.
 *  After this function returns, the RTOS uses the value of ctx for task/context/stack switching.
 *  The concept of a context and of the context_t type is abstract and may have different implementations on
 *  different platforms.
 *  It can be, e.g., a stack pointer or a data structure for user-level task switching as on POSIX.
 *  This function is expected to set ctx to a value that the RTOS can pass to this platform's implementation of
 *  context_switch() and context_switch_first().
 *  The context must be set up such that the destination task of a task switch executes the code at the address fn
 *  using the memory region defined by stack_base and stack_size as its stack.
 *  For hardware platforms, this typically requires the following set up steps:
 *  - The value of ctx points to either the beginning or the end of the stack area.
 *  - The stack area contains fn so that the context-switch functions can pop it off the stack as a return address to
 *    begin execution at.
 *  - Optionally reserve additional stack space if the context-switch functions depend on it.
 * @param fn Points to a code address at which the given execution context shall start executing.
 *  This is typically a pointer to a parameter-less function that is assumed to never return.
 * @param stack_base Points to the lowest address of the memory area this execution context shall use as a stack.
 * @param stack_size The size in bytes of the stack memory area reserved for this execution context.
