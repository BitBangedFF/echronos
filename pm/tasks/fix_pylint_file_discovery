# Motivation

The command `x.py test style` currently produces the output

    Analyzed 74 files with pycodestyle
    Analyzed 66 files with pylint

This suggests that pylint discovers fewer Python files to analyze than pycodestyle.
This may indicate a gap in the test coverage.


# Goals

- Ensure that pylint and pycodestyle analyze all project-specific Python files


# Test Plan

- Verify that all existing regression tests pass.
- Verify that the changes meet the task goals and follow project conventions.
- Verify that the command `x.py test style` reports approximately the same number of files analyzed by pycodestyle and pylint.
