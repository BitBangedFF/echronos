# Motivation

- Currently, a set of `arm-none-eabi-` toolchains is distributed with the RTOS, which are becoming dated.
- We have some pending features that require more recent toolchain versions and cannot be integrated because of this.
- Most linux distributions include more up-to-date toolchains in their package repositories.

# Goals

- Remove the arm toolchains that are distributed with the RTOS (for Linux & Mac).
- Add regression tests that evaluate replacement toolchains present in debian-derivative package repositories.
    - (Note: no regression test will be created for Mac as it is not regression tested at this time)

# Test Plan

- Code review
- Regression tests must pass
