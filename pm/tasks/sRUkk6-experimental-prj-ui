Task: sRUkk6-experimental-prj-ui
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The goal of this task to is experiment / prototype a user interface for the prj tool.

The user interface will be html5 based as it is believed this is the most practical cross-platform user-interface / app development target.

Additionally, this provides a separation of the app in to server-side parts and user-interface parts that has the potential to make for interesting usage scenarios in the future if development correctly.

This initial task may be included, or may simply end up being a throw-away prototype.
