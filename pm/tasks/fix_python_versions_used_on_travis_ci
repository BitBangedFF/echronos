# Motivation

Regression tests on Travis CI currently rely on Python version 3.3 and 3.4, among others, to be available, including the pip Python package manager.
A recent update to the test environment on Travis CI removes Python 3.3 and does not provide pip.
Therefore, all regression tests currently fail.


# Goals

- The overall goal of this task is to allow regression tests on Travis CI to pass again.
- Regression tests shall no longer use Python 3.3, only newer versions of Python.
  This is acceptable as per convention 09aou0.
- Regression tests shall use Python 3.4 only if pip can be made available on the regression test setup with little extra effort (as per convention 09aou0).


# Release Impact: Patch

# Test Plan

- Review the changes introduced by this task and verify that they meet project requirements and conventions.
- Verify that all existing regression tests pass, in particular those on Travis CI with Python 3.5 and 3.6, and potentially 3.4.
