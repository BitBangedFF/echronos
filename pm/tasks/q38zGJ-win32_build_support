Task: q38zGJ-win32_build_support
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

It is currently not possible to build systems for the posix target platform on the Windows host platform.
In particular, this prevents building and executing unit tests on Windows.


Goals
--------

Support for building systems for the posix target platform on Windows as the host platform.

The main limitation on Windows is that neither the MinGW nor the Cygwin toolchains come with an implementation of the ucontext functionality.
(The context-switch implementation for posix depends on this functionality.)
Thus, this functionality needs to be imported and the build process needs to be extended such that it compiles and links in that functionality for posix builds on Windows.


Test Plan
---------

Build any of the posix systems on Windows with Cygwin gcc or MinGW.
For example:
#> ./x.py acamar-gen
#> ./prj/app/prj.py build posix.example.acamar-system
