Task: oCfQVU-client-repositories
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

To protect the intellectual property of our clients, all client-specific code, configuration, documentation, and tooling needs to reside in client-specific repositories to be able to enforce access control.
Ideally, developing and using the RTOS in the core repository or in a client repository is very similar.

Goals
--------

- allow client repositories to integrate the RTOS core repository by including it as a sub-directory

- support that a wrapper in a client repository re-uses the x tool in the core repository and exposes the same functionality and interface

- where applicable, execute x commands invoked through the wrapper in the client instead of the core repository.
  For example, the new-task command, when invoked through the wrapper, shall create the new task in the client repository instead of the core repository.
  In particular, allow the wrapper to inject the location of the client repository for use by the core x tool.
  Ideally, the implementation should support several layers of repository nesting.

[stg: to reduce the size of this task, the last goal will be addressed in task 8n1fwa-extended-client-repositories]
