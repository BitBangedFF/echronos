Task: ZgcBOS-idle-system-flag
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The interrupt component sets the current_task variable to TASK_ID_NONE to mark the system as idle, which is required for profiling.
However, this is unsafe because the context_switch component relies on current_task to retain a valid value and not be TASK_ID_NONE.
The goal of this task is to not set current_task to TASK_ID_NONE but record when the system is idle through a dedicated variable.
The profiling component shall be adapted accordingly.
