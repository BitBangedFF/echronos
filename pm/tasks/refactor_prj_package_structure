# Motivation

The prj package is split into a range of directories, module files, and tests that serve different purposes.
The downsides of this structure include:
- it does not reflect best practices for organizing Python packages in general
- it makes test discovery unnecessarily complicated
These downsides could be mitigated by restructuring the prj package.


# Goals

- restructure prj package to address above shortcomings
- in particular, ensure that the Python library path does not need to be modified and that prj can be run as a package


# Test Plan

- existing regression tests must pass
- code review
