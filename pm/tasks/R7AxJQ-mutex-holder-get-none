Task: R7AxJQ-mutex-holder-get-none
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

The mutex_holder_get() API currently returns TASK_ID_NONE if called on a mutex with no holder.
Since TASK_ID_NONE is an internally defined value, the user cannot currently check for this case.

A trivial way to solve this would be to expose the definition for TASK_ID_NONE, which it would currently return in this case, but this is hazardous because the TaskId width is user-configurable via the prx file.
It would arguably be better practice not to encode this special value in the return type at all.


Goals
--------

Rework mutex_holder_get() API so that the caller can identify when the mutex has no holder, if possible without exposing TASK_ID_NONE.


Test Plan
---------

Existing regression tests.
