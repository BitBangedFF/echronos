Task: 30XA1a-add-pystache-formatting-chars
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

Pystache performs replacement well, however there are sometimes cases where some minimal form of modification is desiraed.
For example, concerting a string to upper-case.
It would be useful to be able to perform these formatting changes direclty in the template, rather than requiring creating special attributes.
Inspired by Python's format specifiers approach, the proposal is that an (optional) formatter may be specified for variable interpolations.

For example:

    {{varname|formatter}}

A user of the library can register formatter with the library.

For example:

   renderer.register('u', string.upper)
   renderer.render('{{foo|u}}', {'foo': 'bar'})

Would output:

   'BAR'

Another approach would be to support the underlying Python __format__.
