Task: XaJQAN-userspace_x86
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

There is currently no support for developing, testing, and debugging systems as user-space applications on host operating systems.
Being able to do so, in particular on the x86 platform, allows developers to leverage all the standard debugging and analysis tools available on their host operating system.
The 'posix' support does not adequately address this need because it is too OS specific.


Goals
--------

- implement a stack and context-switch component for x86 and user-space processes
- create test systems that demonstrate the variants that do not depend on interrupt and timer support to work on Linux and Windows
- create system tests that serve as regression tests for the new test systems


Test Plan
---------

run

    #> . setenv
    #> ./x.py test systems

and verify that the x86 systems are run successfully.
