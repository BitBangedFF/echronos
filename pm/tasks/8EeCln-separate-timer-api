Task: 8EeCln-separate-timer-api
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

Currently the `timer` component contains both the underlying RTOS timekeeping mechanisms, as well as the timer API.
However, we will soon be introducing features (mutex/sem timeouts) that will be dependent on the RTOS' internal timekeeping, to RTOS variants (in this case Kochab) that do not need to expose the timer API.
This motivates our separating the timer API from the underlying timekeeping mechanisms, into two separate components.


Goals
--------

Split the existing timer component into a `time` and a `timer` component, and rework the documentation appropriately.

The scope of the `time` component will anticipate what will minimally be needed in order to implement (1) sleep, and (2) mutex/semaphore timeouts, independently of the timer API.
Note that this means internal RTOS support for per-task, oneshot timers, which is dependent on the existing .prx schema for timer elements being moved to the `time` component.
Since this is unavoidable, we simply choose not to document the timer configuration schema unless the timer API is to be exposed, i.e. the `timer` component is present.

Future work may further separate the internal timer support out from `time` into a `timer-base` component, but for now we will stick to what is strictly necessary to exclude the timer APIs from RTOS variants that don't expose them.


Test Plan
---------

Build and run the existing rigel-system on machine-qemu-simple.

Manually also ensure a mutex/semaphore timeouts prototype (see: robs/lock-wait-timeouts) works on top of these changes.
