Task: CN8WgX-change-entity-name-to-dots
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

Currently entity names are separated by '/'.
This causes a number of interesting problems when considering entity name vs paths, especially on Windows.
This branch should change all entities to be named using '.' as the separator.
'/' and '\' will be illegal characters in entity names.

Notes
---------

In effecting the goals of the task a number of other related aspects regarding module naming were considered.
Specifically, during testing the changes, it was revealed that it is potential to have name ambiguity.
If search paths overlap then it is possible for one file to be accessible via different names.
It was determined that this was undesirable, and as such overlapping search paths is now disallowed (and enforced by the tool).

Additionally, during testing it was noted that it was possible to specify a file via filename, that resulted in an ambiguous module name.
Specifically, if two (non-overlapping) search paths (e.g: 'foo' and 'qux') contained similarly named files, e.g:

    foo/bar.prx
    qux/bar.prx

Then, the resolved entity name for both files is 'bar', which creates an ambiguity.
In this case, entity name 'bar' resolves to 'foo/bar.prx', since 'foo' is earlier in the seach path.
In such a case, there is no entity name that resolves to 'qux/bar.prx', and as such 'qux/bar.prx' is not a valid module, and an EntityNotFound error should be raised.

Additionally, during implementation, it was determined that existing functionality was not well unit-tested which was also improved.
