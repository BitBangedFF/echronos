Task: CN8WgX-change-entity-name-to-dots
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

Currently entity names are separated by '/'.
This causes a number of interesting problems when considering entity name vs paths, especially on Windows.
This branch should change all entities to be named using '.' as the separator.
'/' and '\' will be illegal characters in entity names.
