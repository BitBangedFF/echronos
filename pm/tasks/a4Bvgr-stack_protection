Task: a4Bvgr-stack_protection
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

Some client repositories need to implement hardware stack protection in the rigel variant based on customer demand.

The goal of this task is to extend the rigel configuration schema with:

- an optional dictionary-type entry 'stack_protection'

- an optional int-type sub-entry 'exc_cfg'

Since these entries are optional, they have no impact on other rigel-related code in rtos-core.
