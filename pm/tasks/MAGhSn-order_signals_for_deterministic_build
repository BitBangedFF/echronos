Task: MAGhSn-order_signals_for_deterministic_build
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

When process of generating the RTOS from a template should be deterministic.
That is, if the configuration doesn't change the template should not change.
Currently this is not the case as the RTOS 'signals' are stored in a Python set.
Iteration over a Python set can happen in abitrary order.

Goals
--------

Change the template generation behaviour so that the signals set is iterated in sorted order.
This change shall ensure that template generation is deterministic.

Test Plan
---------

This should not change the behaviour of any existing tests.
A test should be added to ensure that running template generation twice produces the same result.
