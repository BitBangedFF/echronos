# Motivation

The regression tests on TravisCI currently fail on the master branch after having integrated the task integrate_pylint_package_and_use_for_regression_tests.

The test failure is

    $ git branch --track master origin/master
    fatal: A branch named 'master' already exists.

This stems from shell commands in .travis.yml that create a local master branch in the local git repository when using TravisCI.
That local master branch is necessary for some tests to succeed.
However, these shell commands fail when a local master branch already exists, i.e., when testing the master branch itself.


# Goals

- The main goal of this task is to ensure that the regression tests on TravisCI no longer fail.
- .travis.yml shall be updated so that a local master branch is only created when it does not exist yet.


# Test Plan

- Verify that all existing regression tests pass.
- Verify that the changes meet the task goals and follow project conventions.
- Unfortunately, this task is practically impossible to fully test before having been integrated into the master branch.
