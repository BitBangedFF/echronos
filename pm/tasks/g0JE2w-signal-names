Task: g0JE2w-signal-names
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

The goal of this task is to allow the system designer to name signals.
Signal names will be a global name.
The overall schema will be:

    <signals>
     <signal>
       <name>...</name>
     </signal>
     ...
    </signals>

This will produce appropriately named SIGNAL_ID_<name> defines so that programmers need not hardcode signals.
