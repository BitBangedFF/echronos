Task: WkNvlt-posix-unit-testing
==============================================================================

Goals
--------

Currently there is no good way to unit test components.
The approach for unit testing will be to create test harness for components-under-test.
These test harnesses will be similar in form to the existing RTOS skeletons, and will reuse the code for generating these test cases.
Once test cases are created, suitable prx files will also be created that allow compiling a system for the component-under-test.
It is desirable to provide extensive (and even exhaustive) tests.
With such a gaol in mind it is desirable that tests can be written in Python, rather than directly in C.
Rather than creating an executable system during the build process, a shared library (.so) will be created.
The .so file will be accessed using Python's ctypes interface.
