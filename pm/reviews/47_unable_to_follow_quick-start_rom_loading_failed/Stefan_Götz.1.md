How about moving the `cd echronos` to the _Quick-start_ sections, just before the `prj` invocations?
It's just that if one follows the guide to the letter, one checks out qemu inside the echronos repository directory.

[sebastian.holzapfel: Good point, done.]

Just for clarity, how about mentioning whether or not is necessary to build QEMU?
Or more generally, which parts of that README to follow exactly?
