Conclusion: Accepted

Nice work! With the latest changes on the QEMU it works fine on my Ubuntu setup.
The reordered readme is definitely a lot better now! It is nice to follow a
guide and it just works.

One idea that is probably out of scope for this task would be to add a table
of contents at the beginning of the readme. That would make jumping to
specific sections a fair bit easier, and make it clear what the readme actually
contains.
