Specific comments
=================

Location: components/kraz.py & components/rigel.py
Comment: Accepted
The configure() functions contain duplicated code.
Recommend to move code to, e.g., components/signal.py and re-use from there.

Location: components/signal.c
Comment: Accepted
The parameters of signal_poll_set() and signal_peek_set() are not marked as constant although they could be.
Recommend to declare them as constant for improved const correctness.
