Overall comments:

No real problems, some small potential tweaks below.

Specific comments
=================

- There is a change to simple_mutex.py in the patch that seems unrelated
  to semaphores (testing yield for mutex). The change is benign, though.

- The format in simple-semaphore.prx needs documentation:
  Is the <semaphores> .. </semaphores> part optional?
  I assume it only assigns names to a subset of semaphores.

- should the build statically test for num_semaphores < UNIT8_MAX?
  (for SemIdOption encoding to be valid)
