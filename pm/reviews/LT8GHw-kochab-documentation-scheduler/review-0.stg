Comment 1: Rework?
What is the motivation to use the inverse logic in the tag name *preempt_null*?
To me, names such as *preempt*, *preemption*, or *preemptive* would be lots more intuitive.
Would it be worth changing this?

Comment 2: Rework/Review
I've made some changes inline;
please review them.
Please note that all documentation should be written in the present tense unless absolutely necessary to use a different tense.
I've added an according convention.
