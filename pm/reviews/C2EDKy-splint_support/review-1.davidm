Comment:
Nitpick: Would it make sense to document the use of the splint flags? For
example why we explicitly provide the macros and what '+charintliteral' is
needed for. Feel free to ignore this.

Comment:
Personally I would probably err on the side of caution here and use parentheses
around the chained if statements. For example
        internal_assert((mq->messages != 0) &&
                        (mq->message_size != 0) &&
                        ...
Similar to one-line if conditions where it works fine when it is implemented,
but it is easy to subtly break something after modifying it later on.
I leave it to your judgment to change this or not.

Comment:
Nitpick: On line 100 we compare 'mq->messages' against NULL, and on line 139
against 0. It should probably be consistent.
